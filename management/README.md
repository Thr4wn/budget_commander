Management
==========

The point here is to have all manual actions be codified and managed here. The
hope is that you can hit "manage.sh" and it will walk you through all the
manual actions you potentially need to do still.

Actions
------

### Import

See import/README.md for more info.

### Refinement

After importing activity, it's still not official because you need to manually do the following:

 * add categories, subaccounts, and comments
 * split any transactions as needed.
 * anything else you think needs to be done.

After refinement, the activity in pre_activity will be transfered to activity table.
